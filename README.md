# 🚀 LangGraph Agent Workflow System

A production-ready multi-agent workflow system built using LangGraph, enabling stateful, graph-based orchestration of intelligent agents.

This project demonstrates how to create reliable agent pipelines for:

- Research  
- Summarization  
- Question Answering  
- Planning  
- Tool-using Agents  

without relying on proprietary LLM APIs.

## 📌 Features

- 🔗 Graph-based agent workflows  
- 🧠 Stateful execution  
- 🔁 Conditional routing between agents  
- 🧰 Tool calling support  
- 🆓 Works with open-source LLMs  
- 📦 Modular & extensible design
